# Learning-based Real-time Down-sampling for Scalable Decentralized Decision-Making in Swarm Search <br/>

<br/>

(**To be published in JCISE**)
<br/>
In this paper, we proposed a learning based real-time down-sampling method for swarm-search mission and validated its performance on the Bayes-Swarm algorithm for several environments. The supplement associated with the paper can be found in the file Supplement.tex

**The codes for test environment-2 with CNN-BayesSwarm along with baseline down-samplers are in test_env folder.**

**The codes to train a CNN architecture using our low-fidelity training environment are in train_env folder.**
